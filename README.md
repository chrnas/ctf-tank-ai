## Getting started

Clone this repo and then remove the `.git` folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/chrnas/tank-ai-game.git
cd tank-ai-game
```

We also need to add the required libraries pymunk and pygame.
```
pip install --user pymunk
pip install --user pygame
```

To run the game type
```
python ctf.py
```

Use the following command to check that the versions are correct:
```
pip freeze
```


Next go to our [wiki](https://gitlab.liu.se/tdde25/ctf/wikis/home) and get started on the tutorials.
